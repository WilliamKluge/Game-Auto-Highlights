# Game-Auto-Highlights
This project is to take all the screen captures of Overwatch that take up hundreds of gigabytes on our hard drives and automatically create 

## How to use:
1. Take a screen shot when the person to create the highlight reel for gets a kill
2. Open the screen shot in the photo editor of your choice
3. Delete everything from the picture except the name of the person to create the reel for keeping only one instance of 
their name on the screen
4. Save this in the working (same) directory as Game-Auto-Highlights with the name "name.png" (no quotes)
5. Run the program and enter the path of the video file to edit
